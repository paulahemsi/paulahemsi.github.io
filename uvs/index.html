                    ultraVioleta_s é um grupo de teatro e arte tecnologia, composto por Aline Olmos, Laíza Dantas e
                    Paula Hemsi. As componentes são atrizes, gestoras culturais, diretoras artísticas, iluminadoras,
                    editoras de vídeo, programadoras e fotógrafas e são interessadas pela intersecção entre diferentes
                    linguagens artísticas. Atualmente investigam a relação entre teatro, arte tecnologia, programação,
                    vídeo arte e videogame. Tematicamente debruçam-se, em questões ligadas a formas não hegemônicas de
                    existência na Terra, sendo elas humanas, vegetais ou animais.
